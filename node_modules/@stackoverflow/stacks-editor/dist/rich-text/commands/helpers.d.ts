 * Returns a transaction that inserts a new paragraph if there is no node after the cursor.

 * This makes document navigation much more intuitive for end users.
 * @param tr The most recent transaction to the document
 * @param cursorOffset TODO HACK The offset of where the cursor is vs where the inserted node is
