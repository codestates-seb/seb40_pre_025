         * Users can copy & paste tables that originate from anywhere and
         * that use a structure we're not supporting (colspans, rowspans, etc).
         * Our markdown-based table format is pretty limited and trying to deal
         * with all those extravagant tables users might paste is a major pain
         * in the rear and can lead to countless ways of breaking the rich-text
         * document structure.
         *
         * This is why we're intercepting the paste event for tables,
         * find table nodes and replace them with a plain representation of their
         * text content only.
         * This way we avoid major headache at the expense of not allowing to copy
         * and paste table structures.
         *
         * Currently this only goes two levels deep, so this problem persists if
         * someone's pasting a table in e.g. deeply nested blockquotes.
         * A recursive approach would be able to tackle this but prosemirror's `forEach`
         * based implementation makes this awkward to pull off.

         * Users could paste arbitrary stuff into table cells, including
         * nasty stuff like other (partial) table structures. If we don't
         * prevent this, there's a high chance that users can break our
         * quite strict concept of a table layout as prescribed by markdown
         * (each row must have the same amount of cells, etc).
         *
         * To prevent dealing with all edge cases that arise from pasting
         * weird rich-text nodes into a table, this plugin will intercept
         * every paste action that's supposed to insert content _into_ a
         * rich-text table and paste the copied contents as plain text.
